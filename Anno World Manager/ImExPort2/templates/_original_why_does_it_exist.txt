The original templates are stored in the FileDBReader (https://github.com/anno-mods/FileDBReader/tree/master/FileFormats) repository. From the work on and with the Anno World Manager could arise either
(a) an individual adaptation need arises
(b) a new knowledge situation compared to the original templates.

In the case (b) the knowledge situation should be returned absolutely to the Mentainer of the originals.

The subdirectory therefore serves to keep our state of affairs regarding the original templates.
